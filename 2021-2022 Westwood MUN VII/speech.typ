= General Speech

Honorable chair and fellow esteemed delegates,

Considering the global nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need to come up with a better strategy to address vaccine inequity. The UN System-wide COVID-19 Vaccination Programme and the UN's comprehensive response to COVID-19 have taken some action to combat COVID-19. The Czech Republic recognizes the severity of this issue and strongly advocates for equality in the number of vaccine doses per population for all countries to protect the whole world. There is a significant number of countries with low vaccination rates due to the unavailability of the vaccine. Therefore, Czechia strongly suggests that the United Nations take charge of vaccine distribution to expedite the vaccination rate in developing and poor countries. UN global health committees should provide strong guidance to give booster shots to only high-risk populations so that the remaining doses can be sent out to countries that are still in need of the initial doses. In addition, Czechia would like to seek cooperation from countries in the United Nations with a higher than 40% vaccination rate to devise a compromise that would share the unused vaccine doses between the countries that need them the most. Proper compensation should be given to donating countries so that the money can be used effectively for the production of additional doses. Czechia also suggests a contingency plan be created to help limit the spread of COVID-19 while more vaccine doses are created and people become vaccinated. In case of any future pandemic, the United Nations, and specifically UN committees that deal with global health, should, from the start, take charge of distributing vaccine doses among the member nations for each country to get an appropriate share of vaccine-doses based on the country's population, as well as working with vaccine manufacturer companies for an effective distribution system.

The delegate of the Czech Republic now yields the time remaining to the floor.

= Speech for Resolution

One of the topics in the resolution is addressing Vaccination Programs. Non-profit organizations run by volunteer medical professionals will advertise the vaccine and its safety. It promotes the importance of maintaining general sanitization. UN personnel should take charge of distributing the rest of the vaccine doses, as well as the amounts still being manufactured. UN global health committees should provide strong guidance to give booster shots to only high-risk populations so that the remaining doses can be sent out to countries that are still in need of the initial dose. Cooperating countries would be asked to combine their research on COVID-19. Creating awareness in richer countries of why they should donate vaccines is also incredibly important. A compromise would be made to share the unused vaccine doses between the countries that need them the most, with proper compensation sent to the donating countries. Lastly, a contingency plan should be created to help limit the spread of COVID-19 while more vaccine doses are made.
